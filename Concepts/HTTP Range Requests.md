> An HTTP [`Range`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Range) request asks the server to send parts of a resource back to a client. Range requests are useful for various clients, including media players that support random access, data tools that require only part of a large file, and download managers that let users pause and resume a download.
